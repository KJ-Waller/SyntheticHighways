TODOS
* Change histogram method to use cell resolution (degrees/cell) rather than explicit dimensions
    * change plots accordingly
* Make it so that HMM method uses entire G1 map and only keeps bounding box at the end
* Experiments need to be run using train/test set somehow
* Histogram method pipeline needs to be adjusted in paper
